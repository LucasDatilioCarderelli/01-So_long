## How to play

### Execute the game

To play you can execute the executable ``so_long`` passing the map you want to play as parameter, as an example:
```bash
./so_long assets/maps/map_bonus.ber
```

### Controls
Use ``WASD`` or the ``Arrows Keys`` to move. 

You move one tile at a time. Enemies move after you do, and you die when you move into their tile. After picking up all Coins, the exits open and you may leave to see how many moves youâ€™ve used.

You can close the game with ``esc`` or `Q` button.

### Maps
The game is able to play any map you want as long as it follow some specific rules:
* The map has to be a ``.ber`` file.
* It can only contain some of the following characters:

|	Character	|	Object 		|
| - | ------------------------- |
| 1 | Wall.						|
| 0 | Empty space.			 	|
| C | Collectable.				|
| E | Exit.						|
| P | Player starting position  |
| V | Enemy starting position.  |

* The map must be a rectangle surrounded by walls ``1``.
* It must have at least one exit ``E`` and one collectable ``C``. And only one player ``P``.

See some examples in the ``./assests/maps`` folder of this project.
